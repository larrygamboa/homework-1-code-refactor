## Purpose

The purpose of the assignment is to take the website's existing front-end code and improve the code without changing what the website does. The code base has to meet web accessibility standards so that the website is optimized for search engines and people with disabilties have the ability to navigate through the website. To do this, the HTML must follow a semantic structure and be organized while the CSS must be cleaned up by consolidating the selectors and properties. The criteria are as follows:

1) The source code must have semantic HTML elements
2) The structure of the HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
3) The image elements are accessible with alt attributes
4) The heading attributes fall in sequential order
5) The title element has a concise and descriptive title
